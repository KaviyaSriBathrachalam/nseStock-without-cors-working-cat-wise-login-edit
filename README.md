# nseStock-without-cors-working-cat-wise-login-edit

COntroller class has been changed... the last vs code(Spring-nseStock-without-CORS-using-heruko)code program in git has been added to our old nse controller class.

so that we can get the json from heroku without cors and also do post,get in the same project

nsestock-without-cors-working-with-heroku-login-edit(stackblitz) --> this git prrogram --> https://nsestock-wtout-cors-login-edit.herokuapp.com/api/portfolio/category/cnxEnergy  or https://nsestock-wtout-cors-login-edit.herokuapp.com/api/portfolio/category/nifty 

the stackblitz program will first run and make use of heroku and after deploying the heroku code, it will get the values from https://nsestock-wtout-cors-login-edit.herokuapp.com/api/portfolio/category/cnxEnergy through the category{cat} method in spring and show you in portfolio when you check what ever you want then it will take to database which is written in spring. 

the spring program has been pushed into git and heroku uses git program. Get and post method runs and  those values are taken from database and displays in stackblitz.
